## Solution

Download the file :

convertme.py                                       100%[=================>]
```

Exec python script  : 

``` bash
$ python convertme.py

If <random_num> is in decimal base, what is it in binary base?
Answer: 
```

Use a calculator or any programming language to convert the decimal number to binary.

Alternatively, if you want to test the script without relying on random numbers, you can modify the script by setting `num = 0` before running it. This will provide you with a specific number (in this case, zero) to convert to binary.

``` bash
$ python convertme.py

If 0 is in decimal base, what is it in binary base?
Answer: 0
That is correct! Here's your flag: picoCTF{c3ns0r3d}
